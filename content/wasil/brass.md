In the first instance of "Writing about shit I like", I'm going to be listening to the 2020 album *Brass* by Billy Woods and Moor Mother.
Both these artists have become some of my favorite musicians
Billy woods has had a prolific career as a member of Super Chron Flight Brothers and Armand Hammer, as well as a string of solo projects that saw particular praise and attention after 2012's *History Will Absolve Me*.
These two artists worked together on a single for Adult Swim and their synergy on that track *Furies* led to the two working on a full LP with that sound.[1]

Donald Trump has just been inaugurated as president, and immediately he and the GOP have taken to drive the country deeper into Christian fascism using "project 2025" as its blueprint.
In the weeks leading up to this, I found *Brass* to be a fitting backdrop.
Its abstract, dark instrumentation accompanies the rap and spoken word vocals portraying the apocalyptic elements of living within a (colonial post colonial racist capitalist) country (world). The extremes of the exploitation

I think this album may deserve more than I can give, but since I began writing this and listening to it closely I've begun to love it more and more.
So below I'm just going to be including some bits about my favorite parts of each song and a little bit of what I'm thinking in the moment.

### Furies
#### *Low lying cloud, crowd the church spire. The first liar played the lyre so sweet the furies weep*

### The Blues Remembers Everything the Country Forgot
#### *More often than not, the gaze the same. Terror, terrain. Christ in your organs, clock on your brain.*
reconstruction era
Wolf Weston chorus.

### Maroons
#### *Reluctantly sold bud to my white neighbors when they moved in. Yup, that's right, harbingers around.*
Space-y samples in the beat complement the opening bar, *Caravans crisscrossin' dunes, and ants crawlin' on the face of the moon*.

### Rapunzal
#### *LED displays, Pricewaterhouse. Come see what we can do for you, watch your step in the salughterhouse.*
Amazing beat using a warped vocal loop over minimal drums.
End of the world but some things continue. 
*"Rapunzel's hair kept growin' and the nails"*.

### Arkeology
#### *Gold on my Neck, passed down the chain. To remind me of the pain, to remind me of the bank. And you lookin' like you owe me money.*
Elucid verse.

### Blak Forest
#### *I don't know time, but I see it passin' me, while the trumpets play casually. Sound like Albert Ayler, like why these ghosts chasin' me? Thirteen blocks, soundwave realities of what could be.*
was always one of my favorite tracks
beautiful outro by FIELDED.

### Gang for a Day
#### *Don't mind me I be hearin' the voices in your head.*

### Mom's Gold
Chaotic Jazz instrumentation featuring a vocal sample of Moms Mabley. Horrors of a fight for equal rights against powers that fear this, powers that are capable of crushing the people

### Chimney
#### *You can't make this up, well I guess you can.* 
Beat on this track is particularly impressive and immediately grasps me.
Mach-Hommy verse.

### Rock Cried
#### *Landfill smolderin', Hydroxychloroquine unpacked and boxed up again with no point of origin.*
Another industrial, dark beat.
Earth cries

### Scary Hours
#### *Last night it was ten shots, one body. Last night it was ten shots, broke the hearts of everybody.*

### Guinness
#### *Took it all and came home empty, they won't go gently. The whole world in my mobile, it took centuries. The glow unending, the show upended. Like cop cars spooked by the door, I'm a sentry.*
Lack of Privacy in the world today, references to the murder of Breonna Taylor, what little privacy or protection you may have would "spook the cops".

*"Points of principles cannot be given up just because one has got to eat."*

### Tiberius
#### *The heart is intact, arrived from the cusp, retrofit to adapt, to biohack is a privelege. My wires as is I'm not sellin' in my present position. Can I recondition my deep conditionin'? Leave me in the sun, belly up like a lizard.*
Elucid's verse here one of my favorites.

### Giraffe Hunts
#### *The zoo had a decapitated giraffe, a dedicated staff of volunteers, the acid was bad. The gift shop was packed. Congolese hands chopped and dropped in your gift bag. Seepin' blood turned the gift wrap black.*
One of the most beautiful beats. Twists into something darker.
Giraffe Hunts; the colonial powers' plunder of africa, and the continued complacency of people living in colonial/postcolonial powers

### Portrait
#### *It don't matter, it's all matter. If you swing hard enough, the blood pit patter.*
Navy Blue's feature brings in this album's closing track.
Love the beat switch in the end of Moor Mother's verse here and the way it really brings in Billy Woods, a seamless transition.
