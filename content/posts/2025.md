Hello my friend, this post talks a bit about what the past year has been like for me, and what I want to get done in the near future.
I'll preface this buy saying: Right now things look pretty fucking bleak!
But in the past year I feel like I have been able to claw myself out of a hole.
Feeling like I am finally recovering from the depression and career burnout that were inflamed by the pandemic years and life events that followed.
So I hope to at least find some ways to steel my resolve against the potential horrors to come!

In 2024 I continued to improve my physical health

I made some breakthroughs in 2024.
Reconsiled with and accepted some long-known things about myself that has helped grant me the drive to build a  more fufilling life.
I started to find work again after my multi-year slump and have become more outgoing, finding some social scenes in my city and making some new friends.
So I now have things to look forward to each week, and some things to look forward to in the future years to come.
And I now have the motivation to create.

So here we are.
In 2025 I will be finding and building outlets for myself to create, put some more ideas and words out to the world.
I've put together this website, and this post that you're reading now, just so I can begin writing again.
I may have some posts like this where I just talk about life, but I definitely plan to write about shit I love.
When I get this blog off the ground I will hopefully already have an accompanying post about something I love, and encourage some people to check it out.
And I hope to pursue other passion projects, whether artistic or technical.
So far, writing here has been fufilling and no matter how many people see it I hope I can regularly put some words out to the world as part of my routine.

### Some shit I love [that I'm not really gonna write about]

To close this out: Sharing a small list of some things that have made a positive impact on me recently.

2023's fake-HGTV-thriller *The Curse*.
Benny Safdie, Nathan Fielder, and Emma Stone gave us one of the most uncomfortable pieces of media I've personally ever seen.
It is incredible, bizarre, and anxiety-inducing.
The performances and film techniques make what's on screen feel like it's part of our real world.
When things turn upside down I was left with such a strange and unique feeling of Dread that really stuck with me.

[*The Skill Issue, or: How I Learned I Could Learn, and So Can You! (also capitalism is a disease)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSmgNgsW3io)
One of the first longform videos from this youtube channel, Sane Retry.
I watched this one just last week and was impressed with how talented of a storyteller they are.
Through sharing some (depressing) family history they explain exactly the ways in which capitailism steals your time, and your happiness if you let it.
This video contains a compelling argument to take what time you have, whatever time is left after capitailism steals it's time from you, to create art and learn new skills.
And expresses that to do so is an act of rebellion.
Fantastic video and message, this served as a nice lil push for me at the start of the year
