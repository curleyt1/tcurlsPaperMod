Hi there! IF you've stumbled upon my website I just want to have a short welcome post.
When I first made this I had begun to write some things here, but I haven't finished or published anything yet.
If you're curious, I planned for this "posts" section to contain some various thoughts and ongoings in life, and I was planning to have a second section called "writing about shit I love" AKA "wasils"
At the moment this is on pause and I've been spending a bit more time trying to program stuff in python.
If I brush up on my python a bit I'll have access to a bit of remote work, nothing too substantial yet but a good way to ramp back up into programming again.
At the moment in my spare time I'm just working on some bots for things like twitch and discord to issue remote commands.

I'm also very interested in creating some tools for the MiSTer FPGA.
If you haven't heard of it, it emulates a large number of retro game consoles using fully programmable gate arrays.
Basically, it aims to create a 1:1 clone of the original console at a harware level.
There is a linux ARM chip paired to the FPGA which handles things like USB and a file system to load games from.
There are lots of neat things you can do via scripts on the linux side like track playtime of your games and launch a fully random title.
Seems like fun stuff to mess around with.

Anyway, thanks for reading if you got here! That's all I got for this first post, hope you have a great day. :]
